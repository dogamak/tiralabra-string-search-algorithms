/**
 * Abstraction over different implementations of rolling hashing functions.
 *
 * A rolling hash function is a hash function which allows to calculate
 * the hash of a shifting window in a string efficiently, by basing each
 * new hash of a shifted window on the hash of the previous window.
 *
 * For example, consider the hash function {@code h(x) = Î£x modulo 256}.
 * When using ASCII encoding, we get {@code h("tiralab") = 223}.
 * We can derive the hash {@code h("ralabra")} from this by simply adding
 * the ASCII values for the characters {@code r} and {@code a}, substracting
 * the values for characters {@code t} and {@code i} and taking the result's
 * remainder after dividing by 256 (this size of the alphabet).
 *
 * The hash function described above, while extremely efficient to calculate,
 * is not very useful as collisions are extremely easy to manufacture. For
 * example, the strings {@code transmedia} and {@code damnsatire} have the same
 * hash (as do any other anagrams).
