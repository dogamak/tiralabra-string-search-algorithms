# Performance Comparison of String Search Algorithms

This repository contains the project and coursework for the University of Helsinki course TKT20010 (Algorithms and Data Structures Project).
The goal of this project was to implement 4 different string searching algorithms and compare their performance.
Scope of this project is defined in more detail in the [project definition document](docs/project-definition.md).
Results of the performance comparison can be found [here](https://karhusaari.me/tiralabra.html).
